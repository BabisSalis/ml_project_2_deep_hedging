params used
- actor rate, critic rates are set from optuna hyper parameters.
- batch size = 32, episodes 1000.
- epsilon decay = 0.997

Current agent outputs actions from -1 to 1. We could change the action as number of holdings literally.
Next time, we will run the model by changing the action formula.
