params used
- actor rate, critic rates are 10 ** -4
- batch size = 16, episodes 1000.
- epsilon decay = 0.997

this is the very first training done. We did not use hyperparams trained by optuna.
we saw that the rewards dont increase towards zero but diverging.

maybe increase the batch size 32 and use optuna hyperparams.
