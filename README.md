# EPFL CS-433: Project 2 "Deep hedging" (reproducibility challenge)


This is an implementation of the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient reinforcement learning algorithm to perform hedging for a call option, as described in the underlying paper *Deep Hedging of Derivatives Using Reinforcement Learning* (Jay Cao, Jacky Chen, John Hull, Zissis Poulos, 2019). 



## Code description

### `model`

A folder containing different versions of the DDPG implementation (denoted by v1, v2, etc...) defined by the weights of the neural-networks and a text file quickly describing the changes for each version.
